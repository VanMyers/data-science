*Purpose*: Confidence and prediction intervals are useful for studying "pure sampling" of some distribution. However, we can combine CI and PI with regression analysis to equip our modeling efforts with powerful notions of uncertainty. In this challenge, you will use fluid simulation data in a regression analysis with uncertainty quantification (CI and PI) to support engineering design.

# Orientation: Exploring Simulation Results

*Background*: The data you will study in this exercise come from a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [simulation campaign](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932219308651?via%3Dihub) that studied the interaction of turbulent flow and radiative heat transfer to fluid-suspended particles[1]. These simulations were carried out to help study a novel design of [solar receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power), though they are more aimed at fundamental physics than detailed device design. The following code chunk downloads and unpacks the data to your local `./data/` folder.

```{r data-download-unzip}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
## Download PSAAP II data and unzip
url_zip <- "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/24111269"
filename_zip <- "./data/psaap.zip"
filename_psaap <- "./data/psaap.csv"

curl::curl_download(url_zip, destfile = filename_zip)
unzip(filename_zip, exdir = "./data")
df_psaap <- read_csv(filename_psaap)
```

![PSAAP II irradiated core flow](./images/psaap-setup.png) Figure 1. An example simulation, frozen at a specific point in time. An initial simulation is run (HIT SECTION) to generate a turbulent flow with particles, and that swirling flow is released into a rectangular domain (RADIATED SECTION) with bulk downstream flow (left to right). Concentrated solar radiation transmits through the optically transparent fluid, but deposits heat into the particles. The particles then convect heat into the fluid, which heats up the flow. The false-color image shows the fluid temperature: Notice that there are "hot spots" where hot particles have deposited heat into the fluid. The dataset `df_psaap` gives measurements of `T_norm = (T - T0) / T0` averaged across planes at various locations along the RADIATED SECTION.

### **q1** Perform your "initial checks" to get a sense of the data.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Perform your initial checks
df_psaap %>%
  glimpse
```

**Observations**:

-   Most of the variables are simulation conditions.
-   Four variables are simulation results.
-   `idx` is relative to each `x` value (`0.25`, `0.50`, `0.75`, and `1.00`)
-   There are 35 simulations for each location `x`.

The important variables in this dataset are:

| Variable | Category | Meaning                           |
|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `x`      | Spatial  | Channel location                  |
| `idx`    | Metadata | Simulation run                    |
| `L`      | Input    | Channel length                    |
| `W`      | Input    | Channel width                     |
| `U_0`    | Input    | Bulk velocity                     |
| `N_p`    | Input    | Number of particles               |
| `k_f`    | Input    | Turbulence level                  |
| `T_f`    | Input    | Fluid inlet temp                  |
| `rho_f`  | Input    | Fluid density                     |
| `mu_f`   | Input    | Fluid viscosity                   |
| `lam_f`  | Input    | Fluid conductivity                |
| `C_fp`   | Input    | Fluid isobaric heat capacity      |
| `rho_p`  | Input    | Particle density                  |
| `d_p`    | Input    | Particle diameter                 |
| `C_pv`   | Input    | Particle isochoric heat capacity  |
| `h`      | Input    | Convection coefficient            |
| `I_0`    | Input    | Radiation intensity               |
| `eps_p`  | Input    | Radiation absorption coefficient  |
| `avg_q`  | Output   | Plane-averaged heat flux          |
| `avg_T`  | Output   | Plane-averaged fluid temperature  |
| `rms_T`  | Output   | Plane-rms fluid temperature       |
| `T_norm` | Output   | Normalized fluid temperature rise |

The primary output of interest is `T_norm = (avg_T - T_f) / T_f`, the normalized (dimensionless) temperature rise of the fluid, due to heat transfer. These measurements are taken at locations `x` along a column of fluid, for different experimental settings (e.g. different dimensions `W, L`, different flow speeds `U_0`, etc.).

### **q2** Visualize `T_norm` against `x`. Note that there are multiple simulations at different values of the Input variables: Each simulation result is identified by a different value of `idx`.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Visualize the data in df_psaap with T_norm against x;
##       design your visual to handle the multiple simulations,
##       each identified by different values of idx
df_psaap %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = T_norm)) +
    geom_line(
      data = .%>%
        group_by(x) %>%
        summarise(mean_T_norm = mean(T_norm)),
        aes(y = mean_T_norm),
      color = "red",
      size = 3
    ) +
    geom_line(aes(group = idx), color = "black")

df_psaap <-
df_psaap %>%
  mutate(x_factor = factor(.$x, levels = c(0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00)))

df_psaap %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = T_norm, group = x, fill = x_factor)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Modeling

The following chunk will split the data into training and validation sets.

```{r data-split}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
# Addl' Note: These data are already randomized by idx; no need
# to additionally shuffle the data!
df_psaap <- select(df_psaap, -x_factor)
df_train <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 1:20)
df_validate <- df_psaap %>% filter(idx %in% 21:36)
```

One of the key decisions we must make in modeling is choosing predictors (features) from our observations to include in the model. Ideally we should have some intuition for why these predictors are reasonable to include in the model; for instance, we saw above that location along the flow `x` tends to affect the temperature rise `T_norm`. This is because fluid downstream has been exposed to solar radiation for longer, and thus is likely to be at a higher temperature.

Reasoning about our variables---at least at a *high level*---can help us to avoid including *fallacious* predictors in our models. You'll explore this idea in the next task.

### **q3** The following code chunk fits a few different models. Compute a measure of model accuracy for each model on `df_validate`, and compare their performance.

```{r q3-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit these models
fit_baseline <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x)

fit_cheat <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ avg_T)

fit_nonphysical <- 
  df_train %>% 
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ idx)

## TODO: Compute a measure of accuracy for each fit above;
##       compare their relative performance

rsquare(fit_baseline, df_validate)
rsquare(fit_cheat, df_validate)
rsquare(fit_nonphysical, df_validate)
```

**Observations**:

-   Which model is *most accurate*? Which is *least accurate*?
    -   `fit_cheat` is most accurate and `fit_nonphysical` is least accurate.
-   What *Category* of variable is `avg_T`? Why is it such an effective predictor?
    -   `avg_T` is an output of the simulation so it is an effective predictor because it likely is impacted by the same factors as `T_norm` instead of being one of many variables. If one input variable were to describe all variation in `T_norm` it would mean the rest have to have no impact on the simulation.
-   Would we have access to `avg_T` if we were trying to predict a *new* value of `T_norm`? Is `avg_T` a valid predictor?
    -   We would not have access to `avg_T` because it requires running the simulation. If we have done that we would know `T_norm` already so it is not a valid predictor.
-   What *Category* of variable is `idx`? Does it have any physical meaning?
    -   `idx` is metadata. It is a randomized identifier with no physical basis.

### **q4** Use a combination of EDA and train-validation error to build a model by selecting *reasonable* predictors for the `formula` argument. Document your findings under *observations* below. Try to build the most accurate model you can!

**Observations**:

-   Using a random forest approach yielded low success on the validation data, `rsquare ~ .4`.
    -   This could be over fitting
-   The spikiness of `rsquare` makes me suspicious that of whether this method is valid or lucky.
    -   I will compare the peak `rsquare` to a linear model. If it's better than a linear model, this is worth paying more attention to.
    -   I will repeat this method ranking variables by correlation instead of partial correlation instead. I thought partial correlation would be more appropriate for a non-linear model, but I could be wrong.
    -   I also tried brute force but lost patience
    -   max is only `.84` which isn't that good.
-   *Note*: You don't just have to fiddle with `formula`! Remember that you have a whole toolkit of *EDA* tools

## Contrasting CI and PI

Let's revisit the ideas of confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI). Let's fit a very simple model to these data, one which only considers the channel location and ignores all other inputs. We'll also use the helper function `add_uncertainties()` (defined in the `setup` chunk above) to add approximate CI and PI to the linear model.

```{r data-simple-model}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
fit_simple <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(data = ., formula = T_norm ~ x)

df_intervals <-
  df_train %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "confidence", prefix = "ci") %>%
  add_uncertainties(fit_simple, interval = "prediction", prefix = "pi")
```

The following figure visualizes the regression CI and PI against the objects they are attempting to capture:

```{r data-simple-model-vis}
## NOTE: No need to edit this chunk
df_intervals %>%
  select(T_norm, x, matches("ci|pi")) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c("method", ".value"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = matches("ci|pi")
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, fit)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lwr, ymax = upr, color = method),
    width = 0.05,
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    data = df_psaap %>% mutate(method = "ci"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    se = FALSE,
    linetype = 2,
    color = "black"
   ) +
  geom_point(
    data = df_validate %>% mutate(method = "pi"),
    mapping = aes(x, T_norm),
    size = 0.5
  ) +

  facet_grid(~method) +
  labs(
    x = "Channel Location (-)",
    y = "Normalized Temperature Rise (-)"
  )
```

Under the `ci` facet we have the regression confidence intervals and the mean trend (computed with all the data `df_psaap`). Under the `pi` facet we have the regression prediction intervals and the `df_validation` observations.

**Punchline**:

-   Confidence intervals are meant to capture the *mean trend*
-   Prediction intervals are meant to capture *new observations*

Both CI and PI are a quantification of the uncertainty in our model, but the two intervals designed to answer different questions.

Since CI and PI are a quantification of uncertainty, they should tend to *narrow* as our model becomes more confident in its predictions. Building a more accurate model will often lead to a reduction in uncertainty. We'll see this phenomenon in action with the following task:

### **q5** The following code will construct a predicted-vs-actual plot with your model from *q4* and add prediction intervals. Study the results and answer the questions below under *observations*.

**Observations**:

-   Which model tends to be more accurate? How can you tell from this predicted-vs-actual plot?
    -   my `q4` model sis more accurate. The distance between predicted and actual values is smaller.
-   Which model tends to be *more confident* in its predictions? Put differently, which model has *narrower prediction intervals*?
    -   My model from `q4`.
-   How many predictors does the `fit_simple` model need in order to make a prediction? What about your model `fit_q4`?
    -   fit_simple uses 1 predictor while `fit_q4` uses 7.

Based on these results, you might be tempted to always throw every reasonable variable into the model. For some cases, that might be the best choice. However, some variables might be *outside our control*; for example, variables involving human behavior cannot be fully under our control. Other variables may be *too difficult to measure*; for example, it is *in theory* possible to predict the strength of a component by having detailed knowledge of its microstructure. However, it is *patently infeasible* to do a detailed study of *every single component* that gets used in an airplane.

In both cases---human behavior and variable material properties---we would be better off treating those quantities as random variables. There are at least two ways we could treat these factors: 1. Explicitly model some inputs as random variables and construct a model that *propagates* that uncertainty from inputs to outputs, or 2. Implicitly model the uncontrolled the uncontrolled variables by not including them as predictors in the model, and instead relying on the error term $\epsilon$ to represent these unaccounted factors. You will pursue strategy 2. in the following Case Study.

# Case Study: Predicting Performance Ranges

### **q6** You are consulting with a team that is designing a prototype heat transfer device. They are asking you to help determine a *dependable range of values* for `T_norm` they can design around for this *single prototype*. The realized value of `T_norm` must not be too high as it may damage the downstream equipment, but it must also be high enough to extract an acceptable amount of heat.

In order to maximize the conditions under which this device can operate successfully, the design team has chosen to fix the variables listed in the table below, and consider the other variables to fluctuate according to the values observed in `df_psaap`.

| Variable | Value    |
|----------|----------|
| `x`      | 1.0      |
| `L`      | 0.2      |
| `W`      | 0.04     |
| `U_0`    | 1.0      |
| (Other)  | (Varies) |

Your task is to use a regression analysis to deliver to the design team a *dependable range* of values for `T_norm`, given their proposed design, and at a fairly high level `0.8`. Perform your analysis below (use the helper function `add_uncertainties()`!), and answer the questions below.

*Hint*: This problem will require you to *build a model* by choosing the appropriate variables to include in the analysis. Think about *which variables the design team can control*, and *which variables they have chosen to allow to vary*. You will also need to choose between computing a CI or PI for the design prediction.

```{r q6-task}
# NOTE: No need to change df_design; this is the target the client
#       is considering
df_design <- tibble(x = 1, L = 0.2, W = 0.04, U_0 = 1.0)
# NOTE: This is the level the "probability" level customer wants
pr_level <- 0.8

## TODO: Fit a model, assess the uncertainty in your prediction, 
#        use the validation data to check your uncertainty estimates, and 
#        make a recommendation on a *dependable range* of values for T_norm
#        at the point `df_design`
fit_q6 <-
  df_train %>%
  lm(formula = T_norm ~ x + L + W + U_0)

df_uncertain <-
  df_design %>%
  add_uncertainties(
    fit_q6,
    interval = "prediction",
    prefix = "pi",
    level = pr_level
  )

df_uncertain %>% 
  select(pi_fit, pi_lwr, pi_upr)


df_validate %>%
  filter(T_norm > 1.45685 & T_norm < 2.296426) %>%
  count() / count(df_validate)
```

**Recommendation**:

-   How much do you trust your model? Why?
    -   Not very much. Its exceptionally constrained and poorly trained.
-   What kind of interval---confidence or prediction---would you use for this task, and why?
    -   As we are using a model to make predictions we should use a prediction interval. We are not sampling, we are modeling future observations.
-   What fraction of validation cases lie within the interval you predict? How does this compare with `pr_level`?
    -   1/20 which is far lower than `pr_level`
-   What interval for `T_norm` would you recommend the design team to plan around?
    -   the calculated interval `1.45685 < T_norm < 2.296426` is the most informed recommendation I can make but it appears to be a poor interval to use.
-   Are there any other recommendations you would provide?
    -   Further tweaking is required. This model is not currently usable. I recommend a combination of more robust training and experimentation with the selected parameters to achieve a more useful result.

*Bonus*: One way you could take this analysis further is to recommend which other variables the design team should tightly control. You could do this by fixing values in `df_design` and adding them to the model. An exercise you could carry out would be to systematically test the variables to see which ones the design team should more tightly control.
